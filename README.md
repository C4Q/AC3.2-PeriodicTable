# Periodic Collection View of the Elements

## Objective

To build the classic graphical representation of the Periodic Table of the Elements
using a Collection View. The data will come from our familiar elements endpoint and
it will be stored in Core Data. We'll build the cell in a separate nib file.

[Also cute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1TfPDlA1xE), discovered in the related videos. 

1. Fork and clone.
1. Create a project named PeriodicTable inside.
1. Alter the storyboard to be a Collection View embeded in a Navigation Controller.
1. Create a UICollectionViewCell subclass with associated XIB file.

        // Register cell classes
        self.collectionView!.register(UINib(nibName:"ElementCollectionViewCell", bundle: nil), forCellWithReuseIdentifier: reuseIdentifier)

4. bogus data to test collectionview
    let data = [("H", 1), ("He", 2), ("Li", 3)]

5. New data model

symbol, name, number, group, weight
not optional
index number and constrain on it. (index!)

6. Data Controller.swift

7. Element+JSON.swift

8. Steal getData from Elements

9. Add data controller to AppDelegate (CoreArticles)

10. Initialize fetched results controller (cannibalize CoreArticles)

11. First try one section.

12. Then group and number sort.

13. Hmm, how are we going to balance this table?

adjustsFontSizeToFitWidth property of UILabel will not grow up the font size, it is only for reducing according to the documentation: Normally, the label text is drawn with the font you specify in the font property. If this property is set to YES, however, and the text in the text property exceeds the labelâ€™s bounding rectangle, the receiver starts reducing the font size until the string fits or the minimum font size is reached.

But if you set font size big enough (say 200) and set adjustsFontSizeToFitWidth to YES, i think you would get interestingly valuable results.

**Important** And do not forget to set ```Baseline``` as ```Align Centers```, otherwise your text may not be seen properly.

Please inform us about your results.
